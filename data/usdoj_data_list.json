It is important to note that the data (state and country) reflects the residency of the claimant receiving the compensation awards; it does not reflect the location where the individual was exposed. For example, many claimants were exposed to radiation while present in the Southwestern United States. However, the report reflects that compensation awards were sent to residents of many states and countries. Moreover, in cases involving multiple beneficiaries, the data reflects the residency of the lead beneficiary, i.e., the individual who completed the claim form.",

For example, are SARTs characterized by many or few inter-organizational relationships? Do organizations in SARTs tend to have relationships that are reciprocated? Are relationships centered around a focal organization or group of organizations?\nTo understand the associations between these types of inter-organizational relationships. In other words, within SARTs, do inter-organizational relationships tend to be similar across networks of communication frequency, feeling valued by other organizations, and valuing other organizations' work?",

      "description": "The USTP oversees approximately 1,100 private trustees who administer chapter 7 asset and no-asset cases. Chapter 7 trustees are responsible for the collection and liquidation of non-exempt assets, and the distribution of funds to creditors in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code's distribution scheme. When a chapter 7 case with assets is closed, the trustee files a final report that accounts for the disposition of assets, as well as the distribution of funds to creditors and to administrative expenses. The data from final reports filed in 2017 are summarized in this table of key variables. Please review the codebook for variable information.",
